MODULES
----------------------------------------------------------

The Core module is composed of all the core elements that
are used to create JRedis clients and connectors for the
Redis server.  

This includes: 

- the specification (API),
- the reference implementation (RI),
- the benchmark module (BENCH)

An additional module ALL is a virtual module used to 
create a unified jar for the core.  (Its a hack of manve;
likely will be replaced by an assembly directive in the
future.  If you are a maven guru let me know how to do it
better.)

* JRedis users

If you want to use JRedis clients and connectors, you'll
only need the classes of API and RI.  

Depending on your preferences and requirements, you may
either uses the individual jars for each module, OR,
simply use the jar 'with dependencies' in RI's target 
directory.

Each module should also produce a source jar.  (See build
instructions.)

No javadocs are produced as of now.  (c.f. maven newbiness).
