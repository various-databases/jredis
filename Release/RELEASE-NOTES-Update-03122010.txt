Final release for Redis 1.2.n compliant clients.

REQUIREMENTS CHANGES:

Requires Redis server 1.2.n.  This release is NOT compatible with either Redis 1.000 or 2.n (development edge).

See: 
http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/list

NEW FEATURES:

* Heartbeat

Connectors will launch a heartbeat thread to maintain connections.  Frequency can be set using ConnectionSpec, with default of 1/sec.

* Synchronous semantics for Pipeline

See JRedisPipeline.sync().  In a nutshell, allows for mixing in synchronous semantics when using the asynchronous pipelines.  For example, you may issue a set of asynchronous commands (per JRedisFuture interface) and then use pipeline.sync() to obtain a JRedis (synchronous) interface to issue a blocking command.  See UsingJredisPipeline.exampleUseofSyncInPipeline() (in /Examples)


BUG FIX:

A few bugs were reported and have been addressed.  (Thanks to all who provided feedback.)

ROAD MAP:

Development focus will be on Redis 2.n compliance in tandem with Redis edge (http://github.com/antirez/redis), and maintenance for (this) 1.2.n compliant clients.
